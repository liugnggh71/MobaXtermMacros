The Pythagoras High School band has $100$ female and $80$ male members. The Pythagoras High School orchestra has $80$ female and $100$ male members. There are $60$ females who are members in both band and orchestra. Altogether, there are $230$ students who are in either band or orchestra or both. The number of males in the band who are NOT in the orchestra is

$\text{(A)}\ 10 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 20 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 30 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 50 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 70$
\\
Attention:
\\
Ask for member in the band NOT in orchestra
\\
Solution:
\\
There are $100+80-60=120$ females in either band or orchestra, so there are $230-120=110$ males in either band or orchestra. Suppose $x$ males are in both band and orchestra. By PIE, \[80+100-x=110\Rightarrow x=70.\] Thus, the number of males in band but not orchestra is $80-70=10\rightarrow \boxed{\text{A}}$.

Assume every 7-digit whole number is a possible telephone number except those that begin with $0$ or $1$. What fraction of telephone numbers begin with $9$ and end with $0$?

$\text{(A)}\ \frac{1}{63} \qquad \text{(B)}\ \frac{1}{80} \qquad \text{(C)}\ \frac{1}{81} \qquad \text{(D)}\ \frac{1}{90} \qquad \text{(E)}\ \frac{1}{100}$

Note: All telephone numbers are 7-digit whole numbers.

Solution
\\
If each student has $5$ classes, and there are $1200$ students, then they have a total of $5\times 1200=6000$ classes among them.

Each class has $30$ students, so there must be $\frac{6000}{30}=200$ classes. Each class has $1$ teachers, so the teachers have a total of $200$ classes among them.

Each teacher teaches $4$ classes, so if there are $t$ teachers, they have $4t$ classes among them. This was found to be $200$, so \[4t=200\Rightarrow t=50\]
This is answer choice $\boxed{\text{E}}$

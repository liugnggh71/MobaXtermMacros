Nine copies of a certain pamphlet cost less than $\$ 10.00$ while ten copies of the same pamphlet (at the same price) cost more than $\$ 11.00$. How much does one copy of this pamphlet cost?

$\text{(A)}$ $\$1.07$

$\text{(B)}$ $\$1.08$

$\text{(C)}$ $\$1.09$

$\text{(D)}$ $\$1.10$

$\text{(E)}$ $\$1.11$
\\
Solution
\\
Let $p$ be the cost of the first pamphlet, in dollars. The first part tells us \[9p<10 \Rightarrow p<1.\overline{1}\]
The second part tells us that \[10p>11\Rightarrow p>1.1\]
Combining these two parts, the only possible value for $p$ is $1.11$, since $p$ represents a monetary value.

$\boxed{\text{E}}$

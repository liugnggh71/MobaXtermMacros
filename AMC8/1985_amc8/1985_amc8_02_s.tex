One possibility is to simply add them. However, this can be time-consuming, and there are other ways to solve this problem. We find a simpler problem in this problem, and simplify -> $90 + 91 + ... + 98 + 99 = 90 \times 10 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 8 + 9$

We know $90 \times 10$, that's easy - $900$. So how do we find $1 + 2 + ... + 8 + 9$?

We rearrange the numbers to make $(1 + 9) + (2 + 8) + (3 + 7) + (4 + 6) + 5$. You might have noticed that each of the terms we put next to each other add up to 10, which makes for easy adding. $4 \times 10 + 5 = 45$. Adding that on to 900 makes 945.

945 is $\boxed{\text{B}}$

Solution 2

Instead of breaking the sum and then rearranging, we can start by rearranging: \begin{align*} 90+91+92+\cdots +98+99 &=  (90+99)+(91+98)+(92+97)+(93+96)+(94+95) \\ &= 189+189+189+189+189 \\ &= 945\rightarrow \boxed{\text{B}}  \end{align*}
\\
Solution 3
\\
We can use a formula.

It is $\frac{n}{2}\times$ (First term+Last term) where $n$ is the number of terms in the sequence.

Applying it here:

$\frac{10}{2} \times (90+99) = 945 \rightarrow \boxed{B}$

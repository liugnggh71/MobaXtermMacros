Mr. Green receives a $10\%$ raise every year. His salary after four such raises has gone up by what percent?

$\text{(A)}\ \text{less than }40\% \qquad \text{(B)}\ 40\% \qquad \text{(C)}\ 44\% \qquad \text{(D)}\ 45\% \qquad \text{(E)}\ \text{more than }45\%$
\\
Solution
\\
Assume his salary is $100$ dollars. Then in the next year, he would have $110$ dollars, and in the next he would have $121$ dollars. The next year he would have $133.1$ dollars and in the final year, he would have $146.41$. As the total increase is greater than $45\%$, the answer is $\boxed{\text{E}}$

Note that we could have generalized this for any integer $n$.

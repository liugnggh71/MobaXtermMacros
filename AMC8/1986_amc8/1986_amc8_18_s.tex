A rectangular grazing area is to be fenced off on three sides using part of a $ 100$ meter rock wall as the fourth side. Fence posts are to be placed every $ 12$ meters along the fence including the two posts where the fence meets the rock wall. What is the fewest number of posts required to fence an area $ 36$ m by $ 60$ m?

Solution
\\
The shortest possible rectangle that has sides 36 and 60 would be if the side opposite the wall was 60.

Each of the sides of length 36 contribute $\frac{36}{12}+1=4$ fence posts and the side of length 60 contributes $\frac{60}{12}+1=6$ fence posts, so there are $4+4+6=14$ fence posts.

However, the two corners where a 36 foot fence meets an 60 foot fence are counted twice, so there are actually $14-2=12$ fence posts.

$\boxed{\text{B}}$

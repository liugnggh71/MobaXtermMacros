In July 1861, $ 366$ inches of rain fell in Cherrapunji, India. What was the average rainfall in inches per hour during that month?

\[ \textbf{(A)}\ \frac{366}{31 \times 24} \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{366 \times 31}{24} \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{366 \times 24}{31} \\ 
\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{31 \times 24}{366} \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ 366 \times 31 \times 24
\]

Solution

We can express the number of inches of rain in a ratio, $\frac{366 \text{ inches}}{1\text{  month}}$. We need to find to find the number of hours, but first we need to find the number of days. We know there are 31 days in July, so we get \[\frac{366 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ month}} \times \frac{1 \text{ month}}{31 \text{ days}}\]
We know there are 24 hours in a day, so we get \[\frac{366 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ month}} \times \frac{1 \text{ month}}{31 \text{ days}} \times \frac{1 \text{ day}}{24 \text{ hours}}\]
And simplifying gets us $\dfrac{366 \text{ inches}}{31 \times 24 \text{ hours}}$, which is $\boxed{\text{A}}$.

Note that in the simplifying step, we noted that the month and day units cancel, leaving us with only inches per hour.

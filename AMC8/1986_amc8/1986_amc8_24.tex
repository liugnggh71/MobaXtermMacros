The $ 600$ students at King Middle School are divided into three groups of equal size for lunch. Each group has lunch at a different time. A computer randomly assigns each student to one of the three lunch groups. The probability that the three friends, Al, Bob, and Carol, will be assigned to the same lunch group is approximately:

\[ \textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{27} \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{9} \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{8} \qquad
\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{6} \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{1}{3}
\]

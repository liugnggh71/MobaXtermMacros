The smallest sum one could get by adding three different numbers from the set $ \{7,25,-1,12,-3 \}$ is

\[ \textbf{(A)}\ -3 \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ -1 \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad
\textbf{(D)}\ 5 \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ 21
\]
\\
Solution
\\
To find the smallest sum, we just have to find the smallest 3 numbers and add them together.

Obviously, the numbers are $-3, -1, 7$, and adding them gets us $3$.

$\boxed{\text{C}}$

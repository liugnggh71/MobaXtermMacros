A contest began at noon one day and ended $ 1000$ minutes later. At what time did the contest end?

\[ \textbf{(A)}\ 10: 00 \text{ p.m.} \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ \text{midnight} \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ 2: 30 \text{ a.m.} \\
\textbf{(D)}\ 4: 40 \text{ a.m.} \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ 6: 40 \text{ a.m.}
\]
\\
Solution
\\
There are $60$ minutes in an hour. So, we can easily eliminate some of the choices by noting that noon is exactly $720$ minutes away from midnight. Since $720 < 1000$, we know that it cannot be A or B. Because midnight is $720$ minutes away, we know that the contest ended $1000 - 720 = 280$ minutes after midnight. The highest multiple of 60 that will fit into $280$ is $240$, which is $4 \times 60$, and the remainder is $40$ minutes, meaning that the contest ended at $4:40 \text{a.m.}$

$4:40$ is $\boxed{\text{D}}$

A picture $ 3$ feet across is hung in the center of a wall that is $ 19$ feet wide. How many feet from the end of the wall is the nearest edge of the picture?

\[ \textbf{(A)}\ 1 \frac{1}{2} \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ 8 \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ 9 \frac{1}{2} \qquad
\textbf{(D)}\ 16 \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ 22
\]
\\
Solution
\\
Let's say that the distance from the picture to the wall is $x$. Since that distance will be on both sides of the picture (it's in the exact middle), we can say that \begin{align*} x + 3 + x = 19 &\Rightarrow 2x+3=19 \\ &\Rightarrow 2x=16 \\ &\Rightarrow x=8 \\ \end{align*}
$\boxed{\text{B}}$
